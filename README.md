# ELK-Monitoring-Solution
Project: build a cloud-base solution that uses the ELK stack to monitor two vulnerable web applications.

## Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

**Note**: The following image link needs to be updated. Replace `diagram_filename.png` with the name of your diagram image file.

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the playbook file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly available, in addition to restricting access to the network. They are also responsible for efficiently distributing the incoming network traffic to various servers in the network and help to protect the availability of resources. Load balancers protects the system from DDoS attacks by shifting attack traffic across multiple servers. 

The advantage of the jump box is it helps to reduce the attack surface by providing remote connections to the cloud network, and can be secured and monitored as a single node.

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the configuration and system files.

Filebeat helps generate and organize log files to send to Logstash and Elasticsearch. Specifically, it logs information about the file system, including which files have changed and when.
Filebeat is often used to collect log files from very specific files, such as those generated by Apache, Microsoft Azure tools, the Nginx web server, and MySQL databases. 

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.
_Note: Use the [Markdown Table Generator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) to add/remove values from the table_.

| Name     | Function | IP Address | Operating System |
|----------|----------|------------|------------------|
| Jump Box | Gateway  | 10.1.0.4   | Linux            |
| ELK-VM   | ELK      | 10.0.0.4   | Linux            |
| Web-1    | DVWA     | 10.1.0.5   | Linux            |
| Web-2    | DVWA     | 10.1.0.6   | Linux            |

### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the Jump Box machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:
- 103.85.32.43

Machines within the network can only be accessed by Jump Box.
- The Jump Box can access the ELK-VM using SSH. The Jump Box's IP address is 10.0.0.1

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name     | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Jump Box | No                  | 103.85.32.43 (SSH)   |
| ELK-VM   | No                  | 103.85.32.43 (5601)  |
| Web-1    | No                  | 10.1.0.4             |
| Web-2    | No                  | 10.1.0.4             |
 
### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because:
- it is ensure that provisioning scripts run identically everywhere.
- automated configurations will do exactly the same thing every time they run, eliminating as much variability between configurations as possible.
- scripts run quickly and consistently.

The playbook implements the following tasks:
- Install docker
- Install Python3
- Install Docker Python Module
- Increase Virtual Memory
- Download and launch a docker ELK container
- Enable Docker service

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:

- Web-1: IP 10.1.0.5
- Web-2: IP 10.1.0.6

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
- Filebeat

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
- log information about the file system, which files were changed and when.
- it can also collect log files from very specific files, such as those generated by Apache, Microsoft Azure tools, the Nginx web server, and MySQL databases.

### Beats Family.
- Filebeat collects logs and other data.
- Metricbeat collects and reports various system-level metrics for various systems and platforms.
- Packetbeat captures network traffic between servers, and can be used for application and performance monitoring.
- Winlogbeat collect Windows event logs. It can be used to analyze security events, updates installed, and so forth.
- Auditbeat can be used for auditing user and process activity on Linux servers.
- Heartbeat  is used for uptime monitoring, it is probe services to check if they are reachable or not.
- Functionbeat is used for cloud data. It can be deployed as a function to collect and ship data into the ELK Stack.
- Journalbeat is designed specifically for systemd log journals.

### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the playbook files to Ansible Docker Container (/etc/ansible).
- Update the Ansible 'hosts' text file to include webservers and elkservers IP data. This will specify which machine to install the ELK server on and which to install Filebeat on:

    #### /etc/ansible/hosts
		[webservers]
		10.1.0.5 ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
		10.1.0.6 ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3

		[elk]
		10.0.0.4 ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3

- Update the Ansible configuration file /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg and set the remote_user parameter to the admin user of the web servers.
- Run the playbook, and navigate to ELK-VM to check that the installation worked as expected. Kibana can be accessed at http://<ELK-VM-IP>:5601/app/kibana

Commands needed to run the playbooks.

1. Start an ssh session to connect to Jump-Box5ssh with ssh azadmin@(JumpBox-PrivateIP)
2. List the Ansible container: sudo docker container list -a
3. Start the container: sudo docker start (container_name)
4. Attach a docker: sudo docker attach (container_name)
5. Navigate to ansible folder: cd /etc/ansible
6. Install and configure ELK-Server and Filebeat:
    - ansible-playbook elk-playbook.yml 
    - ansible-playbook filebeat-playbook.yml (Installs and Configures Beats)
7. Check that ELK-playbook was installed successfully. Open a new browser and navigate to http://<ELK-VM-IP>:5601/app/kibana
